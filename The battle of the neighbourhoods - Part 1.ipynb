    "# The Battle of Neighborhoods: Introduction/Business Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction and problem:\n",
    "Through this project we would like to help people in exploring better facilities around their neighborhood. Based on this analysis, people can make better decisions on choosing neighborhoods in Scarborough, Toronto.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##  The Location:\n",
    "Scarborough is a favorite destination for new immigrants in Canada to reside in. As a result, it is one of the most distinct and multicultural areas in the Greater Toronto Area, being home to various religious groups and places of worship. Although immigration has become a hot topic over the past few years with more governments seeking more constraints on immigrants and refugees, the general trend of immigration into Canada has been one of the rises.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Foursquare API:\n",
    "This project would use Four-square API as its prime data collecting source as it has a database of millions of places, notably their places API which provides the capacity to perform location search, location sharing and details about a business.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Work Flow:\n",
    "Using credentials of Foursquare API features of near-by places of the neighborhoods would be mined. Due to HTTP request restrictions, the number of places per neighborhood parameter would reasonably be set to 100 and the radius parameter would be set to 500.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Clustering Strategy:\n",
    "To compare the similarities of two cities, we decided to examine neighborhoods, segment them, and group them into clusters to find similar neighborhoods in a big city like New York and Toronto. To be able to do that, we need to cluster data which is a form of unsupervised machine learning: a k-means clustering algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "## Libraries Which are Used to Develope the Project:\n",
    "- Pandas: To create and manipulate data frames.\n",
    "- Folium: Python visualization library would be used to visualize the neighborhood cluster distribution of using an interactive leaflet map.\n",
    "- Scikit Learn: To import k-means clustering.\n",
    "- JSON: Library to handle JSON files.\n",
    "- XML: To separate data from presentation and XML stores data in plain text format.\n",
    "- Geocoder: To retrieve Location Data.\n",
    "- Beautiful Soup and Requests: To scrap and library to handle HTTP requests.\n",
    "- Matplotlib: To Python Plotting Module."

    "Data Link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M\n",

    "## Foursquare API Data:\n",
    "We will need data about different venues in different neighborhoods of that specific borough. In order to gain that information we will use \"Foursquare\" locational information. Foursquare is a location data provider with information about all manner of venues and events within an area of interest. Such information includes venue names, locations, menus and even photos. As such, the foursquare location platform will be used as the sole data source since all the stated required information can be obtained through the API.\n",
    "\n",
    "After finding the list of neighborhoods, we then connect to the Foursquare API to gather information about venues inside each and every neighborhood. For each neighborhood, we have chosen the radius to be 100 meter\n",
    "\n",
    "The data retrieved from Foursquare contained information of venues within a specified distance of the longitude and latitude of the postcodes. The information obtained per venue as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Neighborhood\n",
    "Neighborhood Latitude\n",
    "Neighborhood Longitude\n",
    "Venue\n",
